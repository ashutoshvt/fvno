I was trying to compile the plugin in a directory other
than the source. To ensure that it works properly, the
name of the directory has to be the same as the name
of the shared object. When we import fvno, we need
to let python know of its path through sys.path.append.
Make sure to give the path of directory above the plugin directory. 
So, I created a fvno directory inside the fvno directory and
compiled my plugin there.
