TDC suggestions:

1. Generate FNO, PNO  sparsity plots for all amplitudes
for static electric field perturbations 
at HF level and before HF level with 
and without local occupied orbitals.

2. Use the analyze function in ccenergy for generating 
the sparsity plots of doubles and perturbed amplitudes.
Singles analysis should be easier, hopefully.

A side note:
B3LYP shifts the excitation spectra to longer wavelengths,
i.e lower frequency, which in TDC's words is wreaking havoc
for optical rotatory dispersions. That's why CAM-B3LYP
does a better job as it describes the diffuse rydberg
states better.
