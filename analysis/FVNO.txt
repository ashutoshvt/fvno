I had a discussion about Dr. Crawford today about the NSF proposal 
that he has to submit by the end of this month. He wants to talk about 
coupled cluster based reduced scaling methods for properties. Here are some
of the points that we have observed with regards to the performance of 
these methods for properties:

1. All these reduced scaling methods focus on electron correlation 
   in the ground state wavefunction. The most important terms to 
   describe these correlation effects are obviously the doubles 
   amplitudes in the CC theory. Thus, an obvious choice for any reduced 
   scaling method would be to come up with a basis which creates sparsity in 
   the doubles amplitudes. Ideally, this transformation should happen in 
   a computationally cheaper method whose doubles amplitudes can serve as a guess
   for more accurate methods like CCSD. Naturally, MP2 is the first 
   such method that comes to our mind. Thus, only the significant regions 
   of the MP2 double amplitudes can be used as a guess for CCSD, while the
   sparse regions can be described using MP2.
  
2. These techniques have been shown to be very effective for correlation energies
   and one can remove as much as 40-50 % of the virtual space with errors of less than
   1 kcal/mol. However, we have shown that the extension of these approaches for 
   calculating higer order properties which involve calculations of the derivatives of 
   the wavefunction wrt external electric and magnetic fields yield poor results. 
   The results are not very unsurprising as the reduced scaling basis (RSB) doesn't 
   know anything about the derivative of the ground state wavefunction amplitudes. 

3. How to make the RSB aware of the derivative of the ground state amplitudes. We need to 
   define a perturbation aware 'density' and diagonalize it to create sparsity in the 
   perturbed amplitudes. Should we define a perturbed density based on the perturbed
   doubles amplitudes. We defined one such density by taking the derivative of ground
   state MP2 density but unfortunately we observed only minor improvements.
   
4. One of the possible drawbacks of the above perturbed density approach could be
   the way we defined our perturbed density. In the coupled cluster response 
   formalism used for caluclating higher-order response properties, an expectation 
   value of a one electron operator usually an electric or magnetic dipole is expanded
   in different orders of perturbation with respect to an external field unlike energetics, 
   where we take the expectation value of the hamiltionian which is a 2-body operator.
   This makes the perturbed singles amplitudes more important for the property calculations than
   the perturbed doubles. This is manifested in CCLR as a kind of one electron basis relaxation
   effects. Within this framework, the HF MOs can't see the external field so as to prevent the 
   response function from spurious HF poles. Hence, when we solve the CC response equations, the 
   perturbed singles have higher magnitudes than those of doubles as they incorporate the relaxation 
   of HF MOs to the external field which should be more important than changes in the electron 
   correlation picture. In other words, the perturbation in CC response is a one body operator 
   while we have a 2 body fluctuating potential as a perturbation while describing 
   dynamic electron-correlation. 

5. Based on the above observations, we need to incorporate perturbed singles in the
   definition of our perturbed density. If we look at the leading order contribution
   to the perturbed singles for dipole polarizabilities, it is nothing but a vir-occ 
   block of dipole moment divided by the energy denominator. we can create this density
   as: D(a,b) = \sum_i mu_i^a * mu_i^b/(D_i^a * D_i^b). We can either take an average of 
   ground state density with this or just use this as our new density. 

Things to try out now:

1. Just transform the full virtual space based on the above definition of density and
   see how much we can truncate. 

-- this doesn't seem to work.
(from now on, be specific as to why this doesn't seem to work??)

Here is the analysis part. I am printing the eigen-values of
the perturbed density matrix. As one can see, a lot of 
eigenvalues are close to zero. What does this mean? Lot of 
linear dependencies which means only a few eigenvectors or virtual MOs 
are needed in the new basis to re-construct this perturbed density. 
Lets look at the orbital spatial extent of the orbitals in this basis.

So, there seems to be 2 problems in this pertubed density formalism.

1. Most of the eigenvalues are close to zero, which means a criterion for 
   truncation of the orbitals is not well defined.

2. Also, many diffuse orbitals have very low eigenvalues as shown above.
   and these diffuse orbitals come at the bottom and get removed first

I am thinking of re-validating the results above in the perturbed basis
again as I might have made some mistakes in getting the above results.




The thing that I am looking for is a basis in which diplength is sparse. 
I have seen before that the best basis in which the diplength is sparse
seems to be the canonical basis itself. Let me plot the diplength in the 
perturbed basis as well the canonical basis.

As we can see, canonical MOs with higher energies have very low values of
diplength. How about the diplength in the perturbed basis.

As we can see, the sparsity is lost in the perturbed basis when we
compare it with the canonical basis. Simply because some diffuse 
orbitals still make it to the bottom in the perturbed basis. What 
baffles me here is that the first few diplengths are very small. 
But how can that be possible since the first few virtuals in the 
perturbed basis have very high ONs which should be proportional
to the diplength. That was the whole purpose of such a density formalism.





How about we see a one to one correspondence with \sum_i X^i_a and
diplength to validate these observations. Lets choose all three
pertubations, mu_x, mu_y, mu_z at zero frequency.

Yes, I do see the correspondence here. For high energy virtuals, diplen (guess)
is smaller and so is their final X1s. That was expected!!

*** How about we use X1s from CC2 or TDHF to construct the perturbed density. Let 
   me take a look at the resulting eigen-values. I m not very hopeful though.
 




how about plotting something like:

t1(+e)(\sum_i)(vir) t1(-e)(\sum_i)(vir) d(t1)/de(\sum_i)(vir) d(t2)/de (\sum_ij) (vir * vir)







a. take an average of mp2 ground state density and the dipole density.
b. use the dipole density to identify real important diffuse orbitals. Transform
   everything into this basis. Now create the mp2 ground state density in the
   remaining basis and start truncating. I see only 9 out of 55 virtuals of H2O2
   have significant eigenvalues. so lets create the mp2 ground state density in 
   the rest of virtual space i.e among the rest of 46 virtuals and start truncating.
   Lets see what happens.
   



Things to do now that my method works:

1. Localize the occupied as well using exactly the same method as for virtuals and compare the performance of this method.
2. Look if I can get a suitable correction out of this method for polarizabilities.
3. Extend this scheme for optical rotations.
